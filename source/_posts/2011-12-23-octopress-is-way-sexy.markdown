Wordpress is the undisputed king of the blog engines, but he's getting
fat and bloated, sitting on that throne of his. I recently created an e-commerce
website out of a Wordpress installation -- honestly, is there anything Wordpress
can't do with the right plugin?

But let's face it: using Wordpress is hard work.

<!-- more -->

Migrating from one URL to another is a pain and requires digging into 
the database itself. Updates come regularly but backups are more trouble than 
it's worth. Yes, there's probably a plugin for that, but I expect backups 
to be a standard feature, not an add-on. On top of this, you have to be online 
to write and I'm not always in range of wifi. Granted, it doesn't take a
rocket scientist to do these things, but this particular rocket scientist has
better things to do with his time, like actually write a blog post.

Boy was I ecstatic when I found out about Octopress.

* It's deadbeat simple.
* I get to use my favourite tools: the terminal and vi.
* It uses markdown so I don't have to think about formatting.
* It has responsive CSS so it looks beautiful on my phone (Android, of course).
* It backs itself up onto github with a cronjob.
* It looks way sexy in black.

If you're not afraid of the command line, go give Octopress a try. If you're
99% of the population that can't understand geek-speak, stick with Wordpress.
In the meantime, I'll go ahead and brag about how this self-hosted blog costs
me $0.01 per month to run.
