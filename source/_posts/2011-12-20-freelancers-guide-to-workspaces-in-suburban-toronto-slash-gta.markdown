So you're a freelancer, entrepreneur, or part of a team at a startup company -- congrats for taking the plunge. You're joining thousands of like-minded, driven individuals who have decided to make their dreams a reality instead of just thinking about it. The perks are great: you work on what you like, how you like, when you like, and the commute time is the 5 seconds it takes to walk from your bed to the desk. Life is rosy!

But you'll quickly realize there are some hidden battles to fight, and the most challenging ones are those that come from within. Over the next few weeks, I hope to write about some of these battles and how I've fared against them. This is mostly for my own benefit as I reflect on a year of doing full-time startup work. This week is about the workspace battle.

If you work from home, you'll know this battle well. Your foes are distractions and temptations like the TV, the fridge, the sofa, and even your very own room. There is something about working alone and being too comfortable that makes it difficult to focus on what needs to be done. Maybe there is a psychological effect as well. As the work-home line becomes increasingly blurred, the roles and routines we have also become blurred: "Am I at work? Am I at home?" We may act differently at home than when we're in the workplace and the blurry line makes for great distractions and odd moments of indecisions. "Should I be dressing better even when no one is around? Should I be raking the leaves or calling that client?"

The solution I've found is to work outside of the home once in a while. But you don't need to shell out the big bucks for an office or co-working space, though. Below is a list of free and nearly-free workspaces I've worked out of:

### Public libraries (Toronto and Markham)

*Wifi*: yes  
*Outlet*: generally, yes but not always  
*Noise level*: quiet  
*Price*: free  
*Notes*: Toronto public libraries don't allow SSH connections. My favourites are Fairview (TPL), North York Centre (TPL), Milliken (MPL), and Angus Glen (MPL).
