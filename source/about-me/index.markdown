**Hi there.**

My name is Samuel Wong. I'm a builder-creator, part-time tinkerer, life-long 
learner, and a persistent pursuer of the important things in life, which I 
happen to believe is God, family, and community of all forms.

I'm always looking for a worthwhile project or team to join! Working on 
something awesome? I'd like to be a part of it. Here are some more facts
about me:

**I live in Toronto.**

Toronto is a fantastic place, and we're one of the most technological-advanced cities in the world. According to the Star, Toronto has one of the highest penetrations of the Internet in the world and we're the Facebook capital of the world. I grew up in North York, and I spend much of my time in Markham -- home of AMD, Honeywell, Netfirms, and other great tech companies. I'm also a short subway ride away from the downtown core.

**I'm a rocket scientist.**

I went to school at the [University of Toronto](http://www.engineering.utoronto.ca), in the [Engineering Science](http://engsci.utoronto.ca) program, in the Aerospace stream. EngSci is the best engineering program in Canada, hands-down. We do things other people do in grad school. Other students buy robot parts and build/assemble a robot for their design project -- we do everything from scratch, down to the last solder joint. Four years and a lot of sleepless nights later, I got my Bachelors of Applied Science in May 2006.

After graduating, I went to graduate school at the [University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies](http://www.utias.utoronto.ca),
for a Masters of Applied Science in [Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Combustion](http://arrow.utias.utoronto.ca/~groth). 
We're seriously world-class, and we have the supercomputer to prove it. I was originally slated to do my thesis on 
"Large Eddy Simulation of Premixed Turbulent Combustion using the G-equation Approach with Embedded Boundaries." 
The goal of the research was to build an accurate computer simulation of methane gas burning in air. 
Why do we want this? With an accurate computer model, we can predict pollutant formation, heat release,
flame geometry, and other interesting combustion information, and thus provide a tool for engineers to design 
more efficient combustion engines for aircraft, cars, etc.

However, life didn't go as planned. When does it ever? My research was roadblocked 
at a fundamental level, and after working on this topic for three years, I abandoned 
the topic. I took on a proposal from [Zephyr Alternative Power](http://www.zephyrpower.com) 
to develop a CFD simulation of their vertical-axis wind turbine, with the goal of finding new,
more efficient, geometries. After working on this for two years, I handed in my thesis 
entitled [A Parallel Adaptive-mesh Method for Predicting Flows Through Vertical Axis Wind Turbines](https://s3.amazonaws.com/samuelhwong.com/Wong_Samuel_H_H_201106_MASc_thesis.pdf) in January 2011.

**I'm involved in the community.**

I contribute to a number of Stack Exchange sites such as 
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com), [SuperUser](http://superuser.com), 
and [AskUbuntu](http://askubuntu.com). See my [network profile](http://stackexchange.com/users/360925/rocketscientist). 
I volunteered for [AndroidTO](http://androidto.com), I attend the occasional 
[MobileStartupsTO](http://www.mobilestartupsto.com) meetup, and I'm looking to 
join an Android, Linux, and Rails user group in the near future.

**I'm in it for the challenge and I'm constantly learning.**

Technologies change quickly. Here's how I keep tabs on everything:

* News: [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org), [Engadget](http://engadget.com), [Techcrunch](http://techcrunch.com), [MobileSyrup](http://mobilesyrup.com)
* Blogs: [Heroku](http://blog.heroku.com/), [CodingHorror](http://codinghorror.com), [JoelOnSoftware](http://joelonsoftware.com), [ThoughtBot](http://robots.thoughtbot.com)
* Email newsletters: [RubyWeekly](http://rubyweekly.com), [HTML5Weekly](http://html5weekly.com), [JavascriptWeekly](http://javascriptweekly.com), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com)
* Rails on Twitter: @ruby_news, @rorguru, @RubyReflector, @thoughtbot, @rails, @torontorb, @railstutorial, @ryanbigg
* Android on Twitter: @android

I also buy a lot of books on whatever I'm working on at the moment. I love the [Head First](http://headfirstlabs.com) series, [Pragmatic Bookshelf](http://pragprog.com),
and [O'Reilly](http://oreilly.com). I love loading up my Kindle with tech books.

**I'm a geek, through and through.**

I dabble in everything tech. One day, I'd like to get an Arduino and make a garage door status LED indicator.
Or put together a [server monitoring traffic light](http://hackaday.com/2011/09/17/stoplight-indicator-system-signals-when-your-servers-are-in-distress). 
Or design and build a [remote-control R/C airplane](https://s3.amazonaws.com/samuelhwong.com/airplane.jpg) from scratch. Or a Dalek.
